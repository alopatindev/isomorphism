//! Bidirectional hashmaps!
//! This crate aims to provide a data structure that can take store a 1:1 relation between two
//! different types, and provide constant time lookup within this relation.
//!
//! The hashmaps in this crate use the hopscotch hashing algorithm, mainly because I just wanted to
//! implement it. I'm hoping that the hopscotch hashing algorithm will also make removals from the
//! hashmaps more efficient.
